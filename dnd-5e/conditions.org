* Overview / Caveats

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can
arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or
other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a
few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is
countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by
the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each
instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's
effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is
subjected to a condition.
