* Crusoe's Curious Curioes

Place owned by an eccentric tiefling sorcerer. Who conjures up elf conjurations for his employees.

As you step inside you find a dark room, with a singular light clearing the view of a room wide desk. Three elves standing stone cold at each end. As you take another step inside two torches on opposite walls flicker on.

Elves says the name of the item and the price.

For instance:
   Under the counter and grabs a simple, ebony statue of what seems to be a dog....with a slightly chipped nose from the looks of it."
    - "What is it?" :: "Statue"
    - "What does it do?" :: "Represents"
    - "What is it meant to represent?" :: "Dog"
   The elf puts away the statue...you begin to hear a barking sound for a moment before a whoosh!

Items:

 - Magical W(h)ineskin. That is always full but tastes like tears.
 - bangle of Dari'denah. Gain advantage on performance dance checks
 - Bottomless mug ... literatally doesn't have a bottom.
 - Gauntlets of Sometimes Strength
 - Boots of Sometimes Mobility
 - Rock of Returning
 - ring of feather fall.... that just makes feathers fall from your hands when you wear it.
 - Ever-warm socks
 - Invisibility Ring. The ring turns invisible while worn.
 - Invulnerability Ring. The ring cannot be harmed while worn.
 - The Ring of Attunement. Adds one attunement slot. Must be attuned to use.
 - Dagger Sheath of Warning. Sheathed daggers voice words of warning, but only works whilst sheathed so the voice is super muffled and indiscernable
 - Cloak of Billowing. Bonus action to make the cloak look like it's billowing in the wind.
 - A beautiful goblet that turns any drink poured into it foul, water tastes bitter, wine tastes like vinegar, milk curdles, ect. But the goblet is agreed by all to be the finest looking goblet anyone has ever laid their eyes on.
 - Downy Pillow of Feather Fall: A regular sized gold tasselled green pillow that was enchanted by a narcoleptic Wizard. Holding it to your head and jumping forward will magically float you to the nearest hammock, bed, or soft ground. It can deal 1 HP of bludgeoning damage per round, or float a shield and absorb one projectile attack. When falling you have a 50% chance to make all fall damage reduced to zero. It's semi-animated and loves its owner.
 - A levitation ring that levitates you half an inch off the ground.
