 * *Arachnus Phylarkus.* This delicate mushroom looks like a small black bowl with thin brown gills about 10cm across. It is poisonous to simply ingest but when steeped in boiling water for 10 minutes a thin black tea is created. This tea when consumed grants the drinker resist poison and disease for 4 hours. The mushroom is often the home of a particularly venomous type of spider and is difficult to harvest.
 * *Terra Mirabilis Boletus.* When ingested, this mushroom produces an effect similar to a Reduce Person or Enlarge Person spell. The effect is limited to three rounds. The effect produced is determined by where one bites the mushroom. That is to say, one side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter. The difficulty is determining which side is which, or even where a ‘side' begins and ends on a perfectly round object. Eating the entire mushroom will produce either effect randomly for 1d10 rounds.
 * *Fyngum Stinkus.* This small aquamarine colored mushroom emits a foul smell when crushed. It can be used to overwhelm the senses, cover your scent, prank your friends, or can be distilled into a throw-able stink bomb. (Note, is also known to be a powerful goblin attractant)
 * *Amanita muscaria S. M.* A button mushroom, whose top is red with white spots. The stem is mostly yellow except for two parallel black bars. If it is eaten it produces an effect similar to the enlarge spell, along with immunity to concussions. The effect ends whenever damage is taken.
 * *Seductus Lactimus “Lust-shroom”.* A golden luminescent mushroom with silver spots. Ingesting the mushroom makes the creature who ate it hallucinate, making anything they see appear as a mushroom. Additionally, the creature has an unusually intense desire to consume all other mushrooms in sight which puts them into an uncontrollable rage.
 * *Profundus Obscurus ‘The Deceiver'.* This average brown and purplish mushroom ranges in size, features, and color. No two alchemists can agree on exactly how to classify it, or if they are even discussing the same mushroom. Implicated in untold arguments and altercations throughout history, it wasn't until the Great Debate of the Late Dyvonian Council nearly ended in bloodshed, that David Orelchy pointed out the mushroom exhibited the same energies as the spell ‘Confusion'. When contained in a glass bottle the spores are contained and it can be thrown as a ranged weapon. The affect is 2 d12 wide and lasts for 4 turns unless there is a stiff wind.
 * *Enchantrynium Blistarix Wizard's Bane mushroom.* This large, blue, tall-stalked mushroom gives its consumer a resistance to magical damage for 1 hour, but the consumer must make a DC 15 constitution save after that hour or take 1d4 poison damage. Particularly large specimens can be shared by an entire party.
 * *Betrothitus Indusiatus, aka ‘Bride's Veil'.* A thin, ghostly white mushroom with a thin, veil-like skirt billowing from under its cap. Bride's Veils become almost completely transparent in moonlight and grow at the edges of thick forests. The skirts, though extremely fragile, can be woven together into fabric using a precise hand (though very few have been known to possess the talent) for qualities similar to a cloak of invisibility. When brewed into a tea or liquid, the consumer experiences the effects of Invisibility for 1d4 hours.
 * *Pleurotus Androgenomyces.* A small, dark blue mushroom that grows in clusters of three. It particularly prefers soil that has been soaked in fermented beverages like beer, ale, mead etc... Commonly seen outside of pubs in warmer climates. When consumed fresh it transforms the imbiber into the opposite gender for 1d4 hours and increases Charisma by 1d6 for the entire duration of effect. For this quality it is colloquially known as the ‘False Whores Cap' due to the tendency of poor drunkards to impulsively eat them in order to sell their newfound bodies to bar patrons in order to afford more alcohol.
 * *Visus Invisibilia.* A small, rare, clear transparent mushroom with a milky substance seen throughout the bowl. It grants the person that eats the fungus the ability to see invisible creatures/objects for 4 hours. Upon consumption the PC must do a DC 12 Constitution save or they cannot tell the difference between hallucinations that the fungus can cause.
 * *Tricholgossum Falfortinem and Trichoglossum Fortinem.* Two outwardly identical small fungi that resemble miniature black cats tongues. The T. Fortinem will give those who consume it whole a berserker rage, for 10 minus Con. modifier rounds. After the rage fades, those that consume must make a Con 10 save or gain 1 rank of exhaustion. The T. Falfortinem will give those that consume it a euphoria and a feeling of invincibility. Con 15 save on success, grants resistance to bludgeoning and piercing for 10 minus Con. modifier rounds. On fail those that take it gain a -1 penalty to STR and Con until long rest.
 * *Bufos Draconii or ‘The Dragon Toad'.* A species of 10 different mushrooms of similar shape with scale-like armored caps. Each mushroom is a distinct color and matches the variety of colors that dragon species are known by. Including one for each metallic and each chromatic dragons. Consuming the stem of this mushroom gives you a one-time use of a lesser version of that colored dragon's breath weapon, 4d4 in cone or line depending. Once consumed this mushroom will fatigue the consumer and they will begin to hallucinate for 4d4 rounds. These hallucinations often involve being attacked by a large dragon of the same type as the consumed mushroom.
 * *Yarokol Plenenium.* A small off-white mushroom with a blue-green glow. This mushroom strangely requires a drop of blood to cultivate. When ingested this fungus tastes almost uncannily of meat. The ingester suffers a disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws made to resist enchantment spells cast by the provider of the drop of blood for 2d4 days while the mushroom passes through their system. The effect may be ended early with a greater restoration spell. In addition, while affected by the mushroom, the provider of the drop of blood may cast enchantment spells on the consumer from any distance, if the provider knows where the consumer is. Drow mages have been known to use these mushrooms in a hearty version of a famous lizard egg stew called Nildax Godeneld.
 * *Nubious Mortificantus or Death Cloud.* The stem of this mushroom is a yellow-brown color with a red, purple and green bubble at its top. This enormous mushroom stands at 2-4 feet tall and can grow on trees, rocks or on most ground surfaces. This mushroom has gills but produces spores in a different way. The bubble pod at the top of the stem is about 1 foot wide and when broken or pierced in any way releases a silver-blue cloud of spores that latch onto all surrounding objects. Within 6 hours the spores sprout new fungus that begin to grow and anything they touch. When exposed to spores of this mushroom fall on a living host they will be paralyzed within 6 hours as the mushroom begins to grow. Within 72 hours, without medical assistance, the fungus will spread thin filaments into vital organs and slowly kill its host. Death Cloud patches often obscure bone piles and desiccated husks of their former hosts.
 * *Unguisi Aquilia or Eagles Claw mushroom.* This plain brown mushroom is about 6 cm high and can be distinguished by the large white dots on its gills and stem. Found around the base of very tall trees, Unguisi Aquilia does not appear to have any special properties and is often collected by travelers for a quick supper. However, experienced mages and mushroom hunters know that within minutes of consuming this delicious mushroom humanoids grow wings and large talons on their feet, often destroying clothing and armor in the process. Mages or others who are prepared before they consume this mushroom gain the ability to fly for up to 2 hours and also gain a sweeping talon strike that does 2 d6 of piercing damage. Tales of fireballs raining from the sky are often considered signs of dragon activity when in fact this curios little brown mushroom might be to blame.
 * *Psathyrella Aquatica.* This mushroom can be found in rivers, lakes, and other waterways. It is small and silvery blue with white spots on its cap. When consumed Psathyrella Aquatica gives the ability to breathe underwater for 1d4 hours. Over consumption in humans can cause the consumer to grow gills behind their ears which damage hearing and affects perception.
 * *Locusti Fungili The Mad Cap* mushroom is a small brownish mushroom with a red mark on its cap that is similar to an X. When consumed this mushroom gives its consumer a mental map of its environment within 3d12′ of the spot it was picked.
 * *Magilicus Tempesti or Storm Mushroom* is a relatively large turquoise mushroom that can change weather with release of spoors often using this ability to dampen its environment and call forth small storm when in danger. When disturbed the mushroom releases spores in an upward cone that do 1d6 necrotic damage upon exposure. A small magical lightning storm is formed in a 40′ circle around the mushroom for 1d8 rounds and all creatures who fail their saving throws take 1d4 lightning damage per round while under the cloud.
 * *Myconis Lacusti* is a large black semi-rectangular fungus that often resembles a block of stone. When disturbed it teleports whatever is touching it into a demi-plane consisting of a small room with mushy walls. This plane will only transport its contents back to the mushroom if it is burned. The contents of the demi-plane take 1d6 damage as they teleport back.
 * *Proturbatis Fraudibus or the Joke Cap* is a red mushroom about 2 feet in height with a thick cap. This mushroom was genetically altered by a necromancer long ago to tap into the dead souls of comedic bards. When disturbed the ‘Fun-Guy' reveals a human mouth and spouts a stream of one-liners in common that either antagonize or fascinate the listener but in either case they gain a bonus 1d6 bonus to perception. If anything touches the mushroom however it releases spores in a 20′ cloud that incite spontaneous laughter incapacitating those exposed for 1d4 rounds.
 * *Boletus Aurumni.* This tiny golden mushroom is harmless to touch and delicious to eat raw giving its consumer a 1d6 bonus to constitution for 10 hours. However, certain alchemists know that if collected in bulk and distilled into a think golden syrup, the concoction can be used to turn copper, silver, and other base metals into gold.
 * *Exspiravit Bosletavi.* A pale white mushroom that sheds a phantom silver glimmer in darkness. Said to grow where a man with unfinished business died, it's often found in graveyards and ancient tombs. If properly dried for 24 hours the consumer will be able to cast once speak with the dead. With a failed CON save (CD 10) they will have hallucinations of dead people talking to them. It is said that these hallucinations represent the spirits of the corpses buried under the mushroom even though this is clearly nonsense born from popular superstitions there are rumors of people who found ancient treasures a long time forgotten by following the instructions of this “spirits”. All legends have a seed of truth maybe...
 * *Fortuna Fortinaticus* is a rather normal looking small brown mushroom with green gills that grows mainly in small rings or clusters out of dragon droppings. Coveted for their properties people have attempted to cultivate them for thousands of years to no avail. When one mushroom is consumed all dice roll results automatically get +3 for 1 hour (that is +3 to each die) but consumption of more mushrooms does not increase the bonus at all. At the end of the hour the consumer falls into a deep sleep for 2 hours and no amount of magic or physical prodding can wake them from it.
 * *Champinguini Fumenticatus.* Known as the Smoke Ball mushroom, this large fungus has a fat purple stem that is capped with round yellow globes of thin fragile membrane. The contents of the globules are a smoky blue mist that twists and twines around itself. Any movement or object that causes a globe to break releases the mist which flashes out into a 10′ cloud as if under pressure. Contact with the mist results in instant paralysis unless a CON saving throw is made. This saving throw must be made each round for 1d10 rounds to see if a PC/NPC/Monster is still paralyzed or re-paralyzed. With a successful DEX roll a skillful adventurer who finds this mushroom can extract the globe into a glass or other throw-able container for future use. If someone who is carrying these globes trips, falls, is pushed, leans on, or breaks the globes in any way they should hope that nobody is standing too near to them.
 * *Celeritis Maximus.* Known as Blur Root grows mostly underground and in the Underdark. It is a curious fungus that avoids light and often grows in very dark conditions with just the small cap peeking out of the ground or leaf cover. The cap is small, light green, and sticky but the stem is long and travels underground for several feet. The roots can be harvested with gloves (they do 1d4 necrotic dame on skin contact) and brewed into a strong tea that grants the drinker double movement for 2d6 minutes. Mining dwarfs often encounter the mushroom and keep vials of the tea on them to aid their escape from cave ins or flooding tunnels, but more often they use is to exploit a newly discovered vein of ore as fast as possible before others learn of it. The Drow also use it to kill things faster.
 * *Limus Botelium.* This mushroom is small, green, and slimy to the touch and is often called Slimy Doom. Any creature that eats this fungus begins to bleed uncontrollably, has a disadvantage on CON. checks and saving throws, and whenever they take damage they are stunned until the end of its next turn.
 * *Wizard's Eye.* In the caves of the iron coast grows a mushroom many call the Wizard's Eye. They can be found in the caves by following their reddish glow to the nooks and crannies they propagate in. The mushroom itself is a small round ball that is reddish brown and translucent. Cooked in stew they are tasty and non-reactive but when used in conjunction with a fresh eyeball from any form of humanoid they transform into a useful item called a Wizard's Eye. Placing the mushroom and the fresh eye in a jar together triggers the mushroom to extrude small filaments into the eye and begin to absorb it. Anyone who eats a tendril can see what the new ‘Wizard's Eye sees for 1d12 hours. They are often placed near dungeon doors, in trees, and stuck to ceilings with putty. The Thieves Guild has been known to pay 100gp for specimens as they seem to have no shortage of eyes to use them with.
 * *Morbidis Dulce.* The Sweet Death mushroom is so deadly anything touching it except glass or crystal is wilted and destroyed. Dropping it on someone from above is very mean.
 * *Dusk Cap.* Shared hallucinations.
 * *Pinewood Truffle.* Illuminates the dark when under 100 ft. underground.
 * *Meadboon Fungus.* Tastes like meat: age of mushroom depends on taste of meat.

 * *Night Cap.* This squat specimen sports a dark inky-blue cap with white speckles and a creamy white stem. Known for inducing vivid and intricate dreams when consumed and used in mass to produce dark blue dye. Blackish-purple spore print.
 * *Fool's Night.* Nearly similar to the Night Cap, but featuring a ring around the stem, Fool's Night induces violent nausea for several hours after consumed. Also used in mass to produce dark blue dye. Very light spore print.
 * *Rushroom.* Purple and wrinkly, consuming increases movement speed by 10 feet for an hour.
 * *Murdermoss.* An orange moss that grows in areas polluted with dark magic. Consuming even a little bit forces a DC 20 con check, causing instant reduction to zero on a failure and poisoning on success.
 * *Fumestool.* Looks and smells exactly like a piece of human feces sticking upright out of the ground. Doesn't harm anyone who eats it, but dude! Seriously!?
 * *Willoshroom.* Hundreds of small strands hang down from the mushroom, making it look like a willow tree. It can be made into a poison that both deals 1d4 damage each minute and dulls the senses, causing an afflicted creature to be unable to feel pain.
 * *Cherub's Stool.* It glows dimly when exposed to stars in the night sky (the sun causes it to shrink away). It must be harvested on a new moon for the full effect to take place. When the potion is drunk, the creature becomes a Celestial for the duration of its effects. They can also shed bright light for 30 ft and dim light for 30 ft beyond that as an action. Finally, they heal an extra 1d6 hit points whenever they cast a spell that causes a creature to regain hit points.
 * *Foamcap.* A mushroom with a puffy, spongelike appearance. It most often grows where lightning has struck. Brewing it correctly into a potion can give a consumer resistance or immunity to Thunder damage, while failing the process can deafen the drinker for 1d10 days.
 * *Amanita Marioscaria.* A red toadstool with white spots which is the active ingredient in enlarge potions.
 * *Gripa.* Sometimes known as the sign of tragedy, or the plant of deaths. Rumor has it gripa grows where tragedies have taken place, as a memory of the fallen and their miseries. This purple vine grows as a product of the decomposition of a humanoid. It is often used by hags, which makes them really prone to build settlements around areas rich in gripa. It is rare to find, and with a large enough amount, it can be used as a daily treatment to reduce aging and it's symptoms. It can also be used for purple coloring.
 * *Fishfin Mushrooms.* Fluted and reminiscent of a fish's fins, these mushrooms are found on the underside of fallen tree trunks and have the unusual benefit of giving those who consume them (properly prepared) webbed fingers for 1d4 hours. Unfortunately, regular consumption of these leads to the change becoming permanent and the webbing growing thicker, making fingers much harder to move.
 * *Greencap Mushrooms.* The brilliantly green colored caps of these mushrooms warn off those who might think about eating them, but the bright green color makes a wonderful dye when large quantities of these are boiled! They do have a tendency to stain the fingers of anyone who touches them, though.
 * *Bloomshroom.* A small blue mushroom with a frilled cap, it normally grows in clusters and can be easily mistaken for flowers by those with vision problems or distinct lack of plant knowledge. Unlike flowers, however, the scent of these mushrooms causes those that inhale it to sneeze uncontrollably for 1d6 minutes.
 * *Davian's Tree.* A man-sized brown capped mushroom that retreats underground during the day and emerges at night, appearing to “deflate” or otherwise shrink as it disappears. It's flesh is a delicacy, and during summer it releases spores that are said to be able to mask the taste of any good or drink.
 * *Boggleheart.* A fungal fruiting body, found buried beneath soft soil. This knotted cluster of sponge-like material exudes an inky black liquid when squeezed, and lesser fey purposefully avoid areas in which they grow. This is because the fungus is extremely toxic to faeries and their ilk, to a deadly degree. The spores that permeate above ground are enough to cause sickness in them and contact with the black liquid can bring death.
 * *Orcus's Kiss.* A pale ridge-type fungus that grows out of dead trees, with red veins running through them. Trees that bear this fungus are slowly granted a new life, revived completely over a period of three months.
 * *Creeping Rott.* Sometimes called Devil's Root. This vine grows in long finger-like tendrils that sprout out of warm locations. These tendrils can be ground into an elixir that once consumed gives a creature advantage on saving throws on spells and other magical effects, as well as saves against poison and disease, but any amount of magical healing they receive also reduces their hit point maximum by half that amount for the potions duration (8 hours).
 * *Gall Flower.* A greenish slime mold that blossoms with tiny red spores in the heat of summer. These spores are incredibly toxic and can be refined into a powder which if inhaled can send a creature into toxic shock. An affected creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a success the creature is poisoned for one hour, on a failure the creature is poisoned for this duration but also paralyzed for a number of minutes equal to the number by which they failed the DC by. In contrast, the slime mold itself has great medicinal properties. If applied to wounds over the course of a rest, that creature regains 1d4 additional hit dice as well as 2d4 hit points at the end of that rest.
 * *Imp Stool.* A squat mushroom with a bulbous yellow-green head. Consuming it raw has terrible effects of the metabolic system. The creature takes 1d6 poison damage and must make a DC 16 Con saving throw. On a failure this damage also reduces their point maximum by the damage taken until the end of their next long rest. Creatures that fail this save by are also poisoned for a number of hours equal to the number by which they failed this DC. Can be distilled into a more potent elixir that deals 3d6 poison damage on a failure and half on a success with a DC of 11. This elixir can be added to any other ingestible poison with compounding effect and raising the DC by 1.
 * *Curshroom.* Looks like a skull with, it grows in contact with blood very fast, even if it's inside a person, but it's not deadly, only disfigure the person skin that will grow mushroom, it's treatable but takes a year, you will look horrible but since it's a good source of vitamins it's likely you will never get sick ever again, even once removed.
 * *Plump Helmet.* An incredibly sweet mushroom that the dwarves are known to mash and ferment into a unique kind of ‘wine'. Often cooked with syrup made from the indigenous sweet pod fruits, Plump Helmets are incredibly filling, but aside from this, have no unique effects.
 * *Dimple Cup.* Another mushroom cultivated by the dwarves, Dimple Cups are inedible. However, when ground up finely, their flesh makes a valuable blue dye for clothing. Eating a Dimple Cup can cause severe food poisoning, dizziness, dehydration and death.
 * *Blushroom.* It massively upregulates the cardiovascular system causing increased endurance and the telltale blush of its users. Often used illegally in gladiator rings and other physical sports. If prepared properly (crushed into powder then steamed) it will give a +1 to strength checks for 1d4 hours and advantage on con saves/checks for 12 hrs. If consumed without preparation will give advantage on strength checks for 2d6 hours but the consumer will must make a DC 18 con save every half hour or take 2d6 damage every half hour until the effects ware off.
 * *Dwarven Fart.* This mushroom is the size of a fist and packed full of spores. Crushing it or throwing it will cause it to release a cloud of spores in an area the size of a 5ft radius sphere. Each creature inside must pass a DC 15 check or be poisoned by an hour.
 * *Brain Fungus.* Hear the thoughts of everyone within 60 feet for 3d4x10 minutes. (WARNING, DO NOT CONSUME WITHIN A CITY, LONG AND SHORT TERM MADNESS MAY OCCUR).
 * *Mooshroom.* Turns the player into a cow for 2d10 minutes if they fail a DC 13 CON save.
 * *Jazz Cabbage.* The player can only speak in honks and snorts, making spellcasting nearly impossible, for 1d4 minutes if they fail a DC 15 WIS save.
 * *Crimson Screamer.* You become poisoned and suffer hallucinations, your sonic/thunder spells or abilities become more potent.
 * *Oracle's Consult / Delphi Epiphinata.* You gain insight into the future, you roll a single 1d20 upon consumption and may replace any roll with that value within a 24 hour period. Multiple consumptions within that period lead to 1d2 points of psychic damage for each dose after the first.
 * *Oyster Mushroom.* gain the ability to breath water for 1d8 hours.
 * *Blue-bruise.* 1d20 minutes after consuming, the eater sees into the ethereal plane for 1d4 hours. Disadvantage on perception checks for events/things in the material plane.

 * *Charmshroom.* Gain advantage on Charisma based checks for 1d4 hours.
 * *Tenax Stalk.* When chewed, it chemically alters your hormones for 1d6 hours making your skin develop a white viscous cover, focusing on the extremities [all], that can be used to produce webbing and enable spider climb.

 * *Brown Cap.* nourishing protein, gives free 1 hit die hp.
 * *Purple Haze.* con save 15, if failed enables to see to the ethereal plane for 3d8 minutes

 * *Grayling.* A very plain looking gray mushroom. Causes vision to turn black and white for, gives advantage on perception of movement.
 * *Assassin's Candy.* Black and red with lots of folds. Raw: 4d8 poison damage + poison status dc 18 con save for half damage and no poison status. Cooked: After ingesting 5 times hit points are reduced to 0 and death saves begin each round unless dc 20 con save.
 * *Dragon Funnel.* A family of white mushrooms that are funnel shaped and have colored scales running down their sides. Said to grow on sites where evil dragons have died or have had their blood spilled. Color of the scales determine the elemental affiliation. All give elemental resistance for 8 hours after being eaten cooked with meat
 * *Thief's Folly.* When dried, powdered, and then mixed into clear alcohol, this mushroom produces a clear liquid that can be used to coat any object. When coming into contact with skin, this liquid causes the skin to glow a bright blue for 1d10 hours.
 * *Phoenix Shroom.* Small mushrooms with a pointed, amber colored cap, these mushrooms often grow in tightly packed groups around the ashes of campfires and glow a distinct yellow and red color in the dark. Phoenix shrooms are often mistaken for fires from a distance. When used to make stew these mushrooms have a natural spice that grate those who drink it fire resistance for the next hour per serving eaten.
 * *Temple Bells.* These bronze-colored mushrooms grow in clusters of six. When eaten, they heal 1hp and provide resistance to necrotic damage for 10 minutes.
 * *Bloodcap.* Contact with the spores of this mushroom induces an uncontrollable rage, causing a creature's attack rolls to have advantage but giving attacks against them advantage for 1 minute.
 * *Leaky Inkwell.* The black liquid that oozes from these mushrooms (hence the name) is commonly extracted to be used as ink for spellbooks. Curiously, the ‘ink' is also edible and has a spicy flavor profile.
 * *Kobold Cap.* When ingested, these crimson mushrooms make the consumer hysterical and jumpy as if under the effect of a fear spell.
 * *Tiamat's Toadstool.* These capped mushrooms grow in clusters of 5 with each cap colored to match the chromatic dragons. When ingested, each mushroom grants the consumer resistance to the damage type that corresponds to the color of the caps (red for fire, blue for lightning, green for poison, black for acid, and white for cold). However, eating more than one mushroom within an 8 hour period is harmful to the body and causes 1d8 necrotic damage for each mushroom ingested in that time.
 * *Brawler's Button.* For 4 hours after consuming this bitter mushroom, the consumer's unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 damage and gains a resistance to bludgeoning damage.
 * *False Reaper.* This mushroom causes a humanoid who eats it to make a Con save (DC 13) or become poisoned. If a creature chooses to willingly fail the save by preparing themselves with meditation beforehand they can drop to 0 hit points instead and remain there, suspended in a state of false death nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. This state lasts for 48 hours -- whereupon they may make their death saving throws at advantage. If they succeed their saving throws they immediately come awake with half their HP and a level of exhaustion. If they succeed two, they come awake as above but with 2 levels of exhaustion. If they succeed one, they come awake with two levels of exhaustion and 1 HP. If they fail their saves, they stabilize at 0 and remain unconscious until they come awake naturally or are magically healed, coming away from the experience with two levels of exhaustion and a blinding headache.
